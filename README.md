# responsive-bold-navigation
  Add a cool and bold Responsive Menu in your WordPress site using Responsive Bold Navigation. It supports Font Awesome Icons.


A simple and lightweight WordPress plugin based on the 3D Bold Navigation article by <a href="https://codyhouse.co/demo/3d-bold-navigation/index.html">Codyhouse</a>. I used Font-Awesome for the Icons.
